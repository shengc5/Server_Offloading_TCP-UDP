A computational offloading model with a front server and two backend servers designed to handle different computations. The client communicates with the front server(the edge server) using TCP, the edge then uses UDP to communicate with backend servers to receive computation results

edge.c: serves as the edge server, receives data, send to backend servers and send results to client
client.c: the client that reads computations from a text file and then sends to the edge server
server_and.c: the backend server that deals with "and" computations
server_or.c: the backend server that deals with "or" computations
job.txt: this is the input files that includes computations to be conducted
Makefile: this is the Makefile that automates compilation processes
