Work summary: 
				built a simple model of computational offloading with a front server and two backend servers designed to handle different computations. The client communicates with the front server(the edge server) using TCP, the edge then uses UDP to communicate with backend servers to receive computation results

Files included: 
				edge.c: serves as the edge server, receives data, send to backend servers and send results to client
				client.c: the client that reads computations from a text file and then sends to the edge server
				server_and.c: the backend server that deals with "and" computations
				server_or.c: the backend server that deals with "or" computations
				job.txt: this is the input files that includes computations to be conducted
				Makefile: this is the Makefile that automates compilation processes

How to use: 
				Just as specified by the documentation, enter the command "make all", and then make server_and, make server_or, make edge, ./client xxx.txt

Assumptions:
				This program works under the assumption of less than 100 lines and less than 100 characters per line

Reused code:
				Only two methods, int binaryToDecimal(int num) and int decimalToBinary(int num), from the backend servers were borrowed from online sources. The sources are: 1. http://beginnersbook.com/2015/02/c-program-to-convert-binary-number-to-decimal-number/
